# Pixibo UI Challenge

Please review "Handover Doc.pdf" and "Example Animation.mov". For the test, create a simple webpage (with any background, color or transparent) with body size of no more than 375 x 667 px and follow the steps in the video and the css styles from the HandoverDoc.pdf. Its OK to make assumptions and ask questions regarding the UI. 

Before getting started:
<pre>
1) Clone this github project and create a new Branch with your First Name in it.
2) If you havn't worked with git/github before, hit the download button (green button) and download the zip file
3) Upon completion, either upload to the branch you created or zip your work and email to appdev (at) pixibo.com
</pre>

Provided Files:
<pre>
1) Handover Doc.pdf - This document has all the css and design requirements for the test
2) Example Animation.mov - Is a video preview of what the UI should look like and its behaviour
3) PNG folder - Contains all the images and icons needed for the UI. Use them as needed.
4) Fonts/Sofia Pro folder - Contains the font that we would prefer to be our default font for the UI.
</pre>
