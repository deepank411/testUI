# Pixibo UI Challenge

Story:
As a user, I would like to view  Pixibo's "Pi" demo page hosted and functional with the folllowing details.

Done When - Part I:
<pre>
1) Pixibo's Pi" logo is viewable at the bottom left of the page.
2) "Pi" logo is clickable and should toggle the main Div "PixiboMainContainer"
3) The toggle functionality should slide the main Div "PixiboMainContainer" from top to bottom or bottom to top.
4) "PixiboMainContainer" should comprise of a header div with ID "piHeader", body div with ID "piBody" and a footer div with ID "piFooter".
5) The header div should contain a minimise button and placed on the right end of the div. The minimise button can be "-" minus sign or "x" sign for simplicity.
6) When the minimise button is clicked, the main Div "PixiboMainContainer" should be hidden.
7) Upon successfull load of the main Div, the following events should be triggered
7.1) After the main div is displayed, the loading animation (dot dot dot) should appear at the footer div "piFooter" and must be viewable for 2 seconds.
7.2) Once the loading animation is viewed for 2 seconds, "Hi from Pi" div should be displayed on the "piBody" div followed by "Based on your measurements" div after waiting for another 2 seconds.
