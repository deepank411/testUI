# Pixibo UI Challenge

Please review "Handover Doc.pdf" and "Example Animation.mov". For the test, create a simple webpage (with any background, color or transparent) with body size of no more than 375 x 667 px and follow the steps in the video and the css styles from the HandoverDoc.pdf. Its OK to make assumptions and ask questions regarding the UI. 

Following are some of the frameworks you *may* want to consider:
<pre>
Bootstrap: https://github.com/almasaeed2010/AdminLTE
Sliders: Preferably Bootstrap sliders (Any jquery or css sliders but thats mobile compatible) 
</pre>
